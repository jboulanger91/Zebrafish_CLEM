# clem_zfish1_connectivity_analysis

This folder contains the connectivity analysis and visualization pipeline for traced neurons in the **clem_zfish1** zebrafish hindbrain connectome. It operates on the per-neuron folders (meshes, metadata, synapse tables) generated by the Neuroglancer retrieval pipeline and produces:

- Hemispheric classifications  
- Connectivity summaries and matrices  
- Neural network diagrams  
- Connectome mesh visualizations  
- Activity traces for functionally imaged neurons  
- Enhanced connectomes using LDA-based functional predictions

The main analysis script is:
