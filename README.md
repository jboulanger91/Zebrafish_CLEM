# Zebrafish Hindbrain Functional Connectomics

![Description of the image](home_img.png)

This repository hosts collaborative analyses on the structure–function relationships in the zebrafish hindbrain, integrating anatomical connectivity, morphology-based predictions, and network modeling.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Downloading neuronal morphologies and metadata
Contains tools and scripts for uploading reconstructed neuronal morphologies and associated metadata. 

**Environment file:** `env_clem_zfish1_neuroglancer.yaml`

---

### 2. Connectivity analysis
Contains scripts for analyzing synaptic connectivity and generating connectivity matrices.

**Environment file:** `env.yaml`

---

### 3. Reference brain registration
Pipeline for registering neuronal morphologies to a standardized zebrafish reference brain coordinate framework.
 
**Environment file:** `env.yaml`

---

### 4. Morphology-based prediction of neuronal functional types
Includes scripts to predict functional properties (e.g., motion integrator, motion onset threshold neurons) from morphology.

**Environment file:** `env.yaml`

---

### 5. Connectome-constrained network modeling
Implements computational models that simulate or predict network dynamics under realistic connectome constraints.

**Environment file:** `env.yaml`
